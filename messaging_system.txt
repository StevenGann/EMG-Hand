Universal debug messaging system specification

[##]        2 digit ID number. Unique to every processor/program.
[#]         1 digit priority number. 0 is highest priority.
[text]      String of arbitrary length. This is the message body.
[timestamp] Timestamp applied to message by first node with an RTC.

Messages are generated and passed to a downstream node. When a node receives a message, it
check for a timestamp. If there is no timestamp and the node has an RTC, it adds it.
The message is then passed downstream.

A terminal node is a node that can access an SQL database. This node takes message and
stores them in the database, where they are sorted according to timestamp and can be
filtered by ID number and priority.

Pseudocode:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
if (messageReceived)
{
	String message[4];
	parseMessage(message);
	
	if (message[3] != "")
	{
		message[3] = generateTimestamp();
	}
	
	sendMessage(message);
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

void generateMessage(unsigned int8 ID, unsigned int8 priority, String text, String timestamp)
